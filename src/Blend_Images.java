/** This sample ImageJ plugin filter blends an image with another one,
 *  i.e., it adds another image with user-specified weight.
 *
 *  Dialog Options:
 *    - "Image 2" - allows to select the image that should be added to
 *      the current (foreground) image (named "Image1" below).
 *    - Check "Fix Weight 1 = 1" for calculating
 *          Image1 + weight2*Image2
 *      Without this option, the calculation is
 *          (1-weight2)*Image1 + weight2*Image2
 *    - "Weight 2" is the weight of the second image; it can be positive
 *      (add) or negative (subtract Image2).
 *    - If the current image is a stack, as for most ImageJ commands, a
 *      dialog is displayed asking whether to process the whole stack.
 *      If Image2 is a stack, note that the current slice of Image2 is
 *      always used, even if it is a stack of the same size as Image1.
 *
 *  Notes: Calculations are done on the raw images, not taking grayscale
 *  calibration into account.
 *
 *  Version 2008-10-25 Michael Schmid - preview added. Requires ImageJ 1.38x or later.

/*
A few things to note about (Extended)PlugInFilters:
    1) Plugins working on an image (e.g., filters) should implement the
       PlugInFilter interface. If preview is desired, the ExtendedPlugInFilter
       and DialogListener interfaces should be implemented.
    2) User plugins do not use the package statement.
    3) Plugins residing in the "plugins" folder, and with at least one
       underscore in their name, are automatically installed in the PlugIns
       menu.
    4) Plugins can be installed in other ImageJ menus by packaging them as
       JAR files.
    5) The class name ("Blend_Images") and file name ("Blend_Images.java")
       must be the same.
    6) An ImagePlus is, roughly speaking, an image or stack that has a name
       and usually its own window. An ImageProcessor (ip) carries image data
       for a single image (grayscale or 24 bit/pixel RGB color), e.g. the
       image displayed in the window of an ImagePlus (composite images are
       an exception). Depending on the image type, an ImageProcesor can be
       a ByteProcessor (8 bit), ShortProcessor (16 bit), FloatProcessor (32 bit)
       or ColorProcessor (RGB).
    7) Processing should be done in the run(ip) method. It will be called repeatedly
       to process all the slices of a stack if requested by the user.
    8) This filter works with selections ("region of interest", roi), including
       non-rectangular selections. It is the programmer's responsibility to modify
       only the pixels within the ip.getRoi() rectangle.
       With the flag SUPPORTS_MASKING, for non-rectangular rois ImageJ reverts
       out-of-roi pixels in that rectangle to the original.
    9) For images with a roi, in the run(ip) method one can rely on the
       ImageProcessor ip having the roi of the ImagePlus. Otherwise, this cannot
       be guaranteed.
   10) An ExtendedPlugInFilter is invoked by ImageJ in the folowing way:
       - setup(arg, imp):  The filter should return its flags.
       - showDialog(imp, command, pfr): usually the dialog asking for parameters.
         Preview is possible during this phase: ImageJ calls the run(ip) method.
         The filter should return its flags.
       - setNPasses(nPasses): Informs the filter how often run(ip) will be called.
       - run(ip): Processing of the image; called more than once for stack slices
         with DOES_STACKS flag or RGB images with CONVERT_TO_FLOAT flag.
       - setup("final", imp): called only if flag FINAL_PROCESSING has been specified.
       Flag DONE stops this sequence of calls.
   11) An (Extended)PlugInFilter supports Undo for single images (not for
       processing a full stack) unless one of the NO_UNDO or NO_CHANGES flags
       is specified. ImageJ takes care of storing a copy of the pixels ("snapshot")
       for undo.
Note on this filter:
       This filter uses the following methods of the ImageProcessor class:
       ip.toFloat(i, fp), ip.setPixels(i, fp) and ip.getNChannels(),
       simplifying code that does float operations on grayscale images of
       any type or on the channels of color images. See the run(ip) method below.
